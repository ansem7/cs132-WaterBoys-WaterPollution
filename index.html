The data was then cleaned by fixing blank cells as follows:</p>
						<ul style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 20px;">
							<li>If the waterbody's parameter values for all three years were blank, set all of the yearly values to 0 (with regards to the parameter).<br></li>

				<p>Hypothesis Testing assesses if sample data reflects a true effect or is due to chance, guiding decisions with statistical evidence. The process involves setting up a null hypothesis that there is no effect or difference, and an alternative hypothesis that there is an effect or difference. Statistical tests are then performed to determine whether the observed data is significantly different from what would be expected under the null hypothesis. Upon consultation, we only tested the null hypothesis of research question 2.</p>

							<p class="heading-4"><b>Parameters</b></p>
							<br>
							<b>pH and Temperature:</b> These parameters are relatively stable across regions, with most values close to the mean. A few regions show slightly higher or lower values, but there are no extreme outliers.
							<br><br>
							<b>Dissolved Oxygen (DO):</b> Regions with blue cells have lower-than-average DO, which can indicate decreasing oxygenation and poor water quality. Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations are normally sufficient to maintain healthy biotic assemblages in unpolluted, free-flowing streams, but low or extremely high DO levels can impair or kill fishes and invertebrates.
							<br><br>
							<b>Total Suspended Solids (TSS):</b> Higher TSS levels (red cells) are observed in some regions, indicating higher sediment matter. Lower TSS levels (blue cells) suggest clearer water. When it comes to water quality, high TSS may decrease water's natural dissolved oxygen levels and increase water temperature.
							<br><br>
							<b>Nitrate:</b> Variability in nitrate levels is seen, with some regions showing high levels (red cells), which can indicate agricultural runoff and urban pollution. High nitrate levels are a concern for eutrophication and drinking water safety.
							<br><br>
							<b>Fecal Coliform:</b> Elevated fecal coliform levels (red cells) indicate potential contamination from different bacteria, posing health risks. Lower levels (blue cells) indicate cleaner water.
							<br><br>
							<b>Chloride:</b> High chloride levels are typically associated with having high or elevated total dissolved solids. These can be observed in urban and industrial regions, reflecting pollution from road salt, industrial discharge, and sewage.
							<br><br>
							<b>Color:</b> Highly colored water has significant effects on aquatic plants and algal growth. Light is very critical for the growth of aquatic plants and colored water can limit the penetration of light.
							<br><br>
							<b>Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD):</b> High BOD levels (red cells) are observed in regions with significant organic pollution, reducing oxygen availability for aquatic life. Lower BOD levels (blue cells) indicate less organic pollution.
							<br><br>
							<b>Phosphate:</b> Excessive phosphorus in surface water can cause explosive growth of aquatic plants and algae. This can lead to a variety of water-quality problems.
							<br><br>
							<b>Urban Regions (NCR, Region 3, Region IV-A, Region 11, Region 12):</b> Higher levels of pollutants like chloride, fecal coliform, color, BOD, and phosphate, reflecting urban runoff, industrial discharge, and sewage.
						</span>
					</span>
					<br>
					<span>
						<p><b>Type of Graph:</b> Cluster map</p>
						<br>
						
						<b>Color Scale:</b> Warmer colors represent higher normalized values of the water quality parameters while cooler colors represent lower values.
						<br><br>
						<b>Rows and Columns:</b> Each row represents a region-waterbody combination, while each column represents a water quality parameter.
						<br><br>
						<b>Preprocessing:</b> The water quality parameters values were normalized since we’re dealing with variables having different units or scales. By doing this, we can ensure that each parameter contributes equally to the analysis and that no single parameter dominates due to its scale. The formula used for the normalized value is: (parameter value - mean) / standard deviation.

				<br>
				<p class="heading-4" style="text-align: center;">
					Parameters such as pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Chloride, Color, and Biochemical Oxygen Demand are observed to be increasing through the years. Regions 3, 4A, 11, 12 and 13 have relatively higher levels of the 10 parameters. This signifies possible pollution and low water quality. The only parameter that showed a decrease in levels for three years was temperature (in Region 4A).

							<p class="heading-4"><b>Parameters</b></p>
							<br>
							<b>pH:</b> There is visible increase in pH values within the three years. Almost every waterbody obtained higher levels in 2020 and 2021. Although aquatic animals prefer higher pH levels, an extreme increase in pH levels can still negatively affect the biodiversity.
							<br><br>
							<b>Temperature:</b> These parameters are relatively stable across regions. Only Region 4A in particular has visible changes in coloring (darker to lighter). This means that temperatures in the said region have been decreasing.
							<br><br>
							<b>Dissolved Oxygen (DO):</b> Most of the regions see an increase in Dissolved Oxygen through time, especially waterbodies in rural areas. This can both be good and bad. As mentioned in the primary research question’s interpretation, low or extremely high DO levels can impair or kill fishes and invertebrates.
							<br><br>
							<b>Total Suspended Solids (TSS):</b> Most of the cells show stability with little changes in their colors. On the other hand, the TSS levels in waterbodies in Mindanao can be observed as relatively higher. Higher TSS may decrease water's natural dissolved oxygen levels and increase water temperature.
							<br><br>
							<b>Nitrate:</b> There is stability in almost all of the waterbodies. However, there are outliers with extremely high levels, potentially signifying urban pollution.
							<br><br>
							<b>Fecal Coliform:</b> Fecal Coliform levels are seen as stable. There are some rivers with high values, which indicates contamination.
							<br><br>
							<b>Chloride:</b> High, and increasing levels of chloride can be observed from waterbodies in Regions 3 and 4A.
							<br><br>
							<b>Color:</b> There is not much change in color levels in these waterbodies. There are some with increasing values.
							<br><br>
							<b>Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD):</b> Regions 3 and 4A show high BOD levels. These are regions with significant organic pollution, reducing oxygen availability for aquatic life. On the other hand, most of these values are stable.
							<br><br>
							<b>Phosphate:</b> Most values are low and stable throughout the years except for waterbodies in Regions 3 and 4A. Excessive phosphorus in surface water can cause explosive growth of aquatic plants and algae. This can lead to a variety of water-quality problems.

				<p class="heading-1">To better understand, <b style="color: maroon;">let's discuss!</b></p>
				<br><br>
				<p class="heading-4" style="text-align: justify; margin: 20px;">The results of the exploratory data analysis (EDA) support our hypotheses that there has been a significant change in the water quality parameters across various water bodies from 2019 to 2021. Our nutshell plot also shows a general improvement in terms of water quality in rivers around the Philippines during this period. This upward trend in water quality in our rivers holds great promise for the future of water quality and this suggests that efforts to minimize waste output into rivers have been somewhat effective. Moreover, the findings of our EDA could reflect on future clean-up initiatives and policy implementations to effectively address problems in water quality, availability, and sanitation, especially in rural areas.</p>
				<br>
				
				<span class="rq-disc">
					<span>
						<p class="heading-4" style="margin: 20px;">
							<b>First research question: How do water quality parameters vary across different regions and water bodies in the Philippines?</b>
						</p>
						<p style="margin: 20px; text-align: justify;">
							Our analysis shows that while some parameters like pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen (DO) are relatively uniform across regions, others such as total suspended solids (TSS), nitrate, fecal coliform, chloride, color, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and phosphate exhibit significant variability especially in Urban Regions (NCR, Region 3, Region IV-A, Region 11, Region 12). This variability highlights regions that are more vulnerable to pollution. For instance, higher levels of pollutants like chloride, fecal coliform, color, BOD, and phosphate indicate urban runoff, industrial discharge, and sewage, pointing to pollution sources that need to be addressed. This information is crucial for future interventions such that clean-up organizations and policymakers would be able to target pollution sources more effectively.
						</p>
					</span>
					<br>
					<span>
						<p class="heading-4" style="margin: 20px;">
							<b>Secondary research question: How have the water quality parameters for each waterbody changed from 2019 to 2021?</b>
						</p>
						<p style="margin: 20px; text-align: justify;">
							The temporal analysis of water quality parameters from 2019 to 2021 reveals notable trends such as a steady increase in most parameters (pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Chloride, Color, and Biochemical Oxygen Demand) while the only parameter that showed a decrease in levels for three years was temperature. However, certain regions (Regions 3, 4A, 11, 12, and 13) exhibit relatively higher levels of these parameters, indicating persistent pollution issues. This could help in identifying which region and waterbody needs to be prioritized the most depending on the trends of their respective water quality parameters.

						<p class="heading-4" style="margin: 20px;">
							<b>Socio-Economic Impacts</b>
						</p>
						<p style="margin: 20px; text-align: justify;">
							Our findings could have profound impacts for the socio-economic landscape of the Philippines. Having better insights on water pollution countermeasures and improved water quality can positively impact livelihoods, public health, and biodiversity. 
							<ul>
								<li style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 20px; text-align: justify;">
									<b>Livelihood (Fishing, Tourism, Economy):</b> Cleaner bodies of water support better fishing conditions and enhance tourism, contributing positively to the economy.
								</li>
								<li style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 20px; text-align: justify;">
									<b>Public Health (Sanitation, Access to Clean Water):</b> Cleaner water reduces waterborne diseases, improving public health and reducing healthcare costs.
								</li>
								<li style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 20px; text-align: justify;">
									<b>Biodiversity (Ecosystem):</b> Improved water quality sustains aquatic life and biodiversity, supporting ecosystem health and resilience.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
					</span>
					<br>
					<span>
						<p class="heading-4" style="margin: 20px;">
							<b>Limitations: Our data analysis was also constrained by factors in data availability, domain knowledge, and analysis technique.</b>
						</p>
						<p style="margin: 20px; text-align: justify;">
							<ul>
								<li style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 20px; text-align: justify;">
									<b>Data Availability:</b> We employed purposive sampling to gather data that includes our desired variables. Purposive sampling in our research context introduces potential biases such as generalizability and sampling frame bias. Additionally, Our data was sourced from government websites, which had gaps that we addressed during preprocessing (e.g., calculating averages), potentially introducing statistical noise that affected the overall accuracy. External factors such as the pandemic and unknown data collection methods by our sources introduce uncertainties that could have influenced their data, thereby impacting our analysis.
								</li>
								<li style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 20px; text-align: justify;">
									<b>Domain Knowledge:</b> We lack expertise in the field of water quality and sanitation, resulting in an incomplete understanding of water quality parameters and their interactions. This deficiency affects our analysis and interpretation.
								</li>
								<li style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 20px; text-align: justify;">
									<b>Analysis Technique:</b> We employed MANOVA as our statistical technique for hypothesis testing because we aimed to explore potential correlations among multiple variables. Consequently, the results would be complex and interpreting them can be challenging due to its multivariate nature. MANOVA is also sensitive to outliers and missing data. We addressed outliers by employing log transformations and handled missing data by either computing averages or removing those cases entirely. Overall, our analysis technique is subject to several limitations that are heavily dependent on the organization and cleanliness of our data, which in turn, affects the accuracy of the results.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p style="margin: 20px; text-align: justify;">
							Moving forward, to mitigate the impact of these challenges, we plan to implement several strategies. Firstly, to address our lack of domain knowledge, we will <b>collaborate with experts</b> in water quality and sanitation to gain deeper insights into relevant parameters and their interrelationships. Furthermore, we intend to <b>explore advanced analysis techniques</b>, including machine learning algorithms, to better understand and interpret the data, taking into account potential biases in data collection. By adopting these approaches, we aim to improve the accuracy of our future analyses.
